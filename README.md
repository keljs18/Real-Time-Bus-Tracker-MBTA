# Real Time Bus Tracker MBTA

Real time bus tracking application for the MBTA Route One MIT-Harvard using the MBTA API, utilizing Mapbox to map and mark the live bus locations.

To run the bus tracker, click "Display live bus locations" button which will fetch and display live bus locations and refresh the locations automatically every thirty seconds after clicking. Click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button to display the route one bus stops between MIT and Harvard, click the button again to toggle the bus stops off/on the map. Click on the Legend to see what color corresponds to the stop and bus markers.

Future improvements would be adding event listeners to the javascript actions to await the full loading of the DOM before beginning to parse the data.
